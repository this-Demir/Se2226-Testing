# SE 2226 Term Project – Udemy Web Application Test Plan

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete test documentation and assets for the SE 2226 Software Quality Assurance & Testing term project. The project involves designing and executing black-box tests on the Udemy web platform, applying formal test design techniques and automation tools such as Selenium and JUnit.

The testing focuses on validating core user interactions including login/OTP verification, course search and filtering, wishlist handling, progress tracking, and end-to-end purchase flows.
